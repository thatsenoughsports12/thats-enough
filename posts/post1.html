    <h1>That’s Enough: MLB Umpires Need Thicker Skin</h1>

    <p>Tampa Bay Rays infielder Taylor Walls was ejected Sunday in the ninth inning of his squad’s 1-0 loss to the Houston Astros.</p>

    <p>After a questionable called strike, Walls appeared to tap his helmet — a signal to challenge the call using the Automated Ball-Strike system (ABS). However, the ABS has only been used in the preseason and in Triple A. It has not yet been incorporated into regular season contests.</p>

    <p>Home plate umpire Nic Lentz reacted to Walls’ gesture by tossing him from the game.</p>

    <p>Walls, who denied tapping his helmet, had to be restrained and escorted back to the dugout by teammates and coaches.</p>

    <p>It looked to me like Walls clearly tapped his helmet, but who really cares? NBA officials have to put up with Draymond Green’s antics, which are far worse. Petty gestures like this one shouldn’t be grounds for ejection.</p>

    <p>The sooner the MLB can transition to the ABS, the fewer senseless ejections they’ll have. Then again, situations like this are entertaining and drive engagement for the MLB, so the “human element” of the game might stick around longer than it should.</p>
