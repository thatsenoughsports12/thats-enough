    <h1>That‚Äôs Enough: Get Paul Skenes out of Pittsburgh</h1>
    <p>Paul Skenes is only in his second MLB season and he has already cemented himself as one of the best pitchers in the game. His 2.05 ERA is second in the NL and he‚Äôs one of the few players capable of throwing a complete game if needed.</p>

    <p>However, his success on the mound has been overshadowed by the Pirates‚Äô putrid offense, which ranks 26th in batting average (.226) and 29th in runs scored (194). To put it in perspective, five teams have already crossed 300 runs on the season, three of which have played fewer games than Pittsburgh.</p>

    <p>In Tuesday‚Äôs 3-0 loss to the Houston Astros, Skenes allowed one run on three hits. The defeat dropped Skenes to 4-6 on the year, and the Pirates to 22-39 overall.</p>

    <p>Despite Pittsburgh‚Äôs terrible record, Skenes should undoubtedly remain in the conversation for the NL Cy Young award. But, if he wants to win, he‚Äôll need to escape the Steel City sooner rather than later.</p>
