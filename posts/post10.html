  <h1>That’s Enough: Mike Breen has Lost a Step</h1>

  <p>Tyrese Haliburton’s game-winner in Game 1 of the 2025 NBA Finals was worthy of an iconic call. Unfortunately, Mike Breen didn’t feel that way.</p>

  <p>According to Breen, he refrained from using his signature “BANG” call because Haliburton’s shot because he “saves it for threes.”</p>

  <p>If that wasn’t bad enough, Breen stumbled over his own words after Indiana’s Andrew Nembhard hit a huge three-pointer with two minutes remaining.</p>

  <p>Oh, and he forgot who was playing in the first half.</p>

  <p>There’s no question that Breen is one of the best play-by-play announcers ever, but last night wasn’t his finest outing. He hasn’t been the same since ESPN replaced Mark Jackson and Jeff Van Gundy with Doris Burke and Richard Jefferson.</p>

  <p>Hopefully Breen will have the opportunity to redeem himself later in the series.</p>
